        <p><strong>Step 1 (Grinding Cashews):</strong> Powder the cashew in a <em>coffee grinder</em> or a <em>dry grinder</em>. <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> The cashews should be in <em>powdered form</em> and not become pasty or oily.<br>

        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Meanwhile grease a plate or a <em>tray</em> and keep aside or keep <em>butter papers</em> ready.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> When all the sugar gets dissolved in the water, add the cashew powder. There is <em>no consistency</em> in the sugar syrup required like one string or two string. Just let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Stir and keep on stirring the cashew mixture on a low flame.<br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> The cashew mixture would start thickening. <br>

        <strong>Step 10:</strong> Add the rose petals and ghee or oil to the cashew mixture.<br>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong> When the heat in the mixture is hot enough to handle, then knead the cashew mixture. <br>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong> Flatten the dough and place it on a butter paper or on a greased plate/thali or tray.<br>
        <strong>Step 13:</strong> Place a butter paper on top and then using a rolling pin, roll gently the dough from all sides till you reach a thickness of <em> 3-5 mm</em> in the dough.<br>
        <strong>Step 14:</strong> Remove the butter paper and let the rolled dough cool.<br>
     <strong>Step 15:</strong> When completely cooled, using a sharp knife cut the cashew dough giving <em>square or diamond</em> shapes.<br>
     <strong>Step 16:</strong> Gently remove the <em>kaju katli</em> with a butter knife.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Dry roast the besan in a <em>heavy kadai or pan</em> on low to medium-low heat for about <em>10 to 12 minutes</em>. <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Keep on stirring continuously right from the beginning. So that the besan is not burned and cooks evenly.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> After <em>12 minutes </em>of total roasting time, add the ghee. <br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Mix very well and continue roasting the besan for some more <em>12 to 15 minutes</em> stirring non-stop.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> You will see that the mixture will <em>start releasing ghee</em> and will give a nice <em>fragrant nutty aroma</em>. Some ghee will float on top and and you will see a <em>molten lava kind of consistency</em> where the ghee is <em>floating</em>. The mixture will also loose sides of the pan and become one. These are the signs that the besan is <em>fully cooked</em>. Once you see these signs, you can move on to the next step.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Remove the pan from the stove-top and place it on your kitchen countertop. Add powdered sugar.<br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Begin to mix with all the strength from your hands. You have to mix this part <em>vigorously</em> so that the powdered sugar melts in the roasted besan and ghee mixture and <em>no lumps</em> are formed. <br>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> Add the powdered cardamom, raisins and cashews. Mix again. <br>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong> Once you have mixed the <em>ladoo</em> mixture well then let it become lukewarm or cool at room temperature.<br>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong> When cooled, make small or medium-sized besan ladoo and store them in an <em>airtight steel container</em>. If you are not able to shape in balls then freeze the mixture for <em>5 minutes</em> or refrigerate for <em>20 minutes</em>. Depending on the quality and consistency of ghee as well as the room temperature you may be able to easily shape these or not.<br>
    <br>
    Serve <em>besan ke laddu</em> garnished with some nuts!
